Fork update:
I changed the code, so it works in OnShape and similar CAD applications. I used AI to help me, since I do not code usually.
The Stl and Step files are all replaced. I optimized it for 3D printing. 
The Mouse can be assembled directly after printing, no support matirial needed. See Print_All.stl for optimal orientation.
The Base_bottom can be filled after printing no pausing needed. I used plaster to weighten the Base. Steel would be better, lead would be best.
